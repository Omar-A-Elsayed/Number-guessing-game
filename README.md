# Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ®

## Overview

The **Number Guessing Game** is a simple, console-based game where players try to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts. The game has two difficulty levels: **Hard** and **Easy**, each with different ranges of numbers and allowed attempts.

## How It Works

- The player selects a difficulty level.
  - **Hard**: Guess a number between 1 and 100, with 5 attempts.
  - **Easy**: Guess a number between 1 and 50, with 10 attempts.
- The game prompts the player to guess a number within the selected range.
- After each guess, the game gives feedback:
  - **Too high**: If the guessed number is higher than the correct number.
  - **Too low**: If the guessed number is lower than the correct number.
  - **Correct**: If the guessed number matches the correct number.
- The player either wins by guessing the correct number or loses if they run out of attempts.

## Features

- Two difficulty levels: **Easy** and **Hard**.
- Feedback after each guess to help the player adjust their guesses.
- Random number generation based on the chosen difficulty.
- Input validation to ensure guesses are within the allowed range.

## Code Snippet: Difficulty Selection

The game allows players to choose between two difficulty levels: **Hard** and **Easy**. Hereâ€™s the code that handles the difficulty selection:

```
const selectDifficulty = () => {
  while (randomNumber == null) {
    const difficultyLevel = prompt(
      "Choose Difficulty level {1 : Hard}, {2 : Easy} : "
    );

    if (
      Number.isInteger(Number(difficultyLevel)) &&
      difficultyLevel >= 1 &&
      difficultyLevel <= 2
    ) {
      if (difficultyLevel == 1) {
        randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
        tries = 5;
        limit = 100;
      } else if (difficultyLevel == 2) {
        randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 50) + 1;
        tries = 10;
        limit = 50;
      }
    } else {
      console.log("Enter one or two to determine the difficulty level.");
    }
  }
};
```

## How to Play

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd number-guessing-game
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:  
   Ensure you have Node.js installed, then run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the game**:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

5. **Choose a difficulty** when prompted:

   - Enter `1` for **Hard** (1-100 with 5 attempts).
   - Enter `2` for **Easy** (1-50 with 10 attempts).

6. **Start guessing** the number! The game will guide you with feedback on whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.

## Example

```bash
node index.js
Choose Difficulty level {1 : Hard}, {2 : Easy} : 1
Guess a number between 1 and 100 (Note: you have 5 tries left.): 50
Too high
Guess a number between 1 and 100 (Note: you have 4 tries left.): 25
Too low
Guess a number between 1 and 100 (Note: you have 3 tries left.): 35
Correct!
```

## Dependencies

- **prompt-sync**: prompt-sync: Used to handle synchronous input from the user in the console.

## Enjoy the Game

Feel free to use and modify the game as you like, and challenge your friends to see who can guess the correct number in the fewest attempts! ðŸŽ‰
